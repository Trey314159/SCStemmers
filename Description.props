# Description (required)
Description=This package contains Java implementations of three previously published stemmers for Serbian - two stemmers, greedy and optimal, by Keselj and Sipka, and one by Milosevic. It also contains a stemmer for Croatian by Ljubesic and Pandzic. All stemmers require the input text to be in UTF-8. The stemmers for Serbian accept text in both the Cyrillic and Latin scripts as input, and give the output in the Latin script. The stemmer for Croatian works only with texts in the Latin script. Performance comparisons between the stemmers (on the task of sentiment analysis) can be found in the paper "Reliable Baselines for Sentiment Analysis in Resource-Limited Languages: The Serbian Movie Review Dataset", Vuk Batanovic, Bosko Nikolic, Milan Milosavljevic, in Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016), Portoroz, Slovenia (2016). See the webpage for the list of reference papers and more information.
